# Library_Checkouts
This was my final project for CMSE 201 during Fall 2020. It analyzes library checkout data to determine seasonal and long-term trends in the popularity of various subjects, in addition to determining the impact of COVID on these trends. In particular, the following subjects were investigated:
* Travel and Vacations
* Cooking
* Knitting, Crocheting, and Embroidery
* Politics
* Self-Improvement
* Exercise and Fitness

The data is too large to add to GitHub, although a copy can be sent by request. A more recent version of the dataset is available online at https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6.
